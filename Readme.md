# Frontify Color API

Hello there! 👋

This task aims to show us where you stand as a developer, what your coding style is, and to have a basis for discussion.

For this purpose, create a simple and elegant RESTful API server for creating, reading, updating, and/or deleting 
operations on a Color entity. A Color should have a name and a HEX value. Pick one or more operations for a simple 
workflow to show how well and properly you engineer solutions, even for simple problems. Do it as well as you would 
expect for a code review by yourself. Work on top of the existing skeleton and Git history.

Keep in mind, we need a basis for discussion, not a fully-fledged enterprise solution. It's fine when features aren't 
implemented completely. Spend at most a few hours.

## Rules of the Game

- Don't use any further library or framework.
- You have to write the code — no code generators or assistants allowed (e.g., GitHub Copilot).
- Feel free to change existing code (or fix existing problems) as you see fit.
- Don't share the code publicly; just send it back to us.
- **Enjoy!**

## Skeleton Setup

**Requirements:** PHP 7.3+, node.js (optional, format the code manually if you don't use Prettier).

We use [http-server-request](https://github.com/sunrise-php/http-server-request) to abstract PHP's `$_SERVER`
and `$_REQUEST` superglobals, [Prettier for PHP](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php) for code-formatting
and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing:

```shell
npm i && php composer.phar install
```

Run PHP's built-in server available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

```shell
npm start
```

Execute the PHPUnit tests via NPM shortcut:

```shell
npm test
```
